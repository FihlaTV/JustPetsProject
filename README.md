JustPets is an e-commerce mobile application that runs on the android platform. The application aims to provide dog-walking services, pet products, veterinary and grooming services for the users. Users can make a user-profile after signing up and add their pets to their profile. Upon selecting the “Walker” services, users can book a dogwalker available at the requested time. Users can also take the benefit of in-built Pet-shop and pay via PayPal/credit card. A Dog walker can login into the application and view their bookings and set their available time. Dog walkers can also use user-centric service from the dog walker view. A GPS functionality is included in the application for the users to track the dog walkers when the service starts.
